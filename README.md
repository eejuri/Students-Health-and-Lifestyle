# Students-Health-and-Lifestyle
My research objectives were to explore and describe health and lifestyle habits of the University of London MSc Data Science students. In my study I replicated part of the health and lifestyle survey conducted at the University of Edinburgh and compared my results with that survey. Overall, my study found that the majority of UoL MSc Data Science students pursued a relatively healthy lifestyle, apart from having sleep and mental health issues.
